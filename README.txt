# Epic-Browser
This a browser, that is built on .NET Framework 4.7.2. You can use and copy this browser, but i think you are going to don't try to do something with it.

This browser may have issues at some websites, because it supports .NET Framework, if I be interested to continue this matter, then I going to use .NET 

To run the browser, open EpicBrowser folder and run EpicBrowser.exe file.
